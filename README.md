# PHP Find similar images
PHP ( with easy SimpleImage library) 
<br/>
Can detect similar images (Ex:-due to multiple captures at same place same time which has slight differences.May be eyes closed in one and opend in one) with out understanding anything in the image.<br/>
No face ditection or nothing with the need the help of neural networks.Just simplifies the image in to a general form and compares with any other image to calculate how similar those images are.
## Fast
Simplifying proccess is so fast.<br/>
Comparing process takes a time propotioal to the images in the data set (Images to be checked if a match)
<br/> **Still it's just a matter of substracting 16 X 3 integers per one check.So nothing to worry about!**
